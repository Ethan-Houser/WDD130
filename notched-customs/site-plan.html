      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Is your GameCube controller giving out? Or do you want a controller that fits your unique style? 
        I prioritize having controllers that give that same nostalgic feel in your hands of the original 
        GameCube controller, but with customizations unique to your needs and taste. Whether you 
        need a repair, or you want to have a controller that will support you in the competitive scene, I 
        have what you are looking for. Having been in the competitive scene myself using GameCube 
        controllers, I know how important it is to have a controller that feels right at home in your 
        hands. Allow me to do the same for you and help you find or create a controller that will look 
        and feel at home in your hands.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is youth, adults, and professional players who use gamecube controllers.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>New Custom Controllers</h3>
      <p>
        We provide controllers with unique custom designs and button feel. We design and paint the shell of the controller (or the outside plastic) to fit your unique style. 
        The colors of the buttons can also be customized to fit the theme of the rest of the controller. The controllers can be hydro dipped, hand painted, or spray painted. 
        This gives you countless options in color and design. We also provide the option to have your buttons sanded. This is to help your fingers glide over the buttons to make it easier to make fast inputs without accidentally hitting the wrong button. 
        Typically, only the A button is sanded, but other buttons can be sanded according to your needs. We can also change how the bumpers on the controller feel. 
        By using different strengths of springs, we can make the bumpers have a lighter, more sensitive touch. This is great for people looking to have an edge on the competition.

      <h3>Replacement Parts</h3>
      <p>
        Fixing a GameCube controller is easy! Whether you have mushy button inputs, buttons aren't clicking, or you just want to replace parts of the controller, we have an assortment of parts and tools at your disposal. 
        Replacing parts in a GameCube controller is easy enough for anyone to do and is often self explanatory. If there are any parts you need, we have them, and you can fix your controller in the comfort of your own home. 
        For first time repairs, we recommend buying our tri-wing screwdriver as GameCube controller shells cannot be removed without one. We also have different springs for the controller's bumpers, 
        so if you want the buttons to be easier or harder to push down, just change out the springs. This is especially useful for competitive players who want better control over their inputs. 
        If you are having mushy buttons - which sometimes doesn't input the button you push - buy our replacement contact pads. 
        They have the same feel as the original controller's contact pads, making them way better than your generic brand. Z button isn't working or is hard to click down? 
        There's a button for that! We even have a replacement motor if you want to have the rumble feeling in your controller.

      <h3>Controller Shell Customization</h3>
      <p>
        Don't want to buy a whole new controller, but you want your controller to have a new look? No worries, we've got you covered. 
        Send in your controller and we can give it a custom paint job. This includes hydro dipping, hand painting, and spray painting. 
        We can even go as far as giving the controller a matte or glossy look and feel. Sometimes having a matte paintjob can give the controller 
        a “grippier” feel so that it better sits in your hands while you are playing.
