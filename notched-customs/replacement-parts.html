                Fixing a GameCube controller is easy! Whether you have mushy button inputs, 
                buttons aren't clicking, or you just want to replace parts of the controller, we 
                have an assortment of parts and tools at your disposal. Replacing parts in a GameCube 
                controller is easy enough for anyone to do and is often self explanatory. If there are 
                any parts you need, we have them, and you can fix your controller in the comfort of your 
                own home. For first time repairs, we recommend buying our tri-wing screwdriver as GameCube 
                controller shells cannot be removed without one. We also have different springs for the 
                controller's bumpers, so if you want the buttons to be easier or harder to push down, just 
                change out the springs. This is especially useful for competitive players who want better 
                control over their inputs. If you are having mushy buttons - which sometimes doesn't input 
                the button you push - buy our replacement contact pads. They have the same feel as the original 
                controller's contact pads, making them way better than your generic brand. Z button isn't 
                working or is hard to click down? There's a button for that! We even have a replacement 
                motor if you want to have the rumble feeling in your controller.
